He is commonly depicted as a humanoid with three pairs of white feathered wings, bearing a weapon of great fury, and armor matching the culture depicting him.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>Bastion teaches the importance of justice and liberty, and bids his followers to oppose injustice and tyranny wherever it may be found. Evil is to be sought out and destroyed, and its wrongs to be redressed by the hand of the righteous. With the brutal and fleeting nature of life, Bastion also goads his worshippers to make merry and enjoy life while it lasts.</p>\n<h2>Followers</h2>\n<p>As one of the two sons of Amanda, Bastion enjoys widespread popularity, with temples neighboring hers or annexes in her temples.</p>\n<p>Those who dedicate their lives to Bastion are those who wish to protect the innocent and punish the guilty on a more personal level, and thus commonly can be found as adventurers of unique zeal and candor, or as traveling errant who right wrongs. Any who show the desire and aptitude to become clergy or paladins are trained and welcomed with open arms.</p>\n<p>Temples of Bastion have a tendency to resemble inns more than they do temples, and the brewing of consecrated beers nd meads are both a religious ritual and one more excuse to congregate. The more popular and larger temples have open air training fields where clergy can practice. The one universal element to all temples of Bastion, however, is the <strong><em>Vault of Unanswered Sins</em></strong>. This vault holds scrolls that detail wrongs that have been committed, but have gone unpunished. Many are brought in by those in the community that surrounds a temple, but a precious few appear in flashes of divine light. All are researched by the temple and their allies and, if found worthy of redress, are taken up as quests.</p>"
